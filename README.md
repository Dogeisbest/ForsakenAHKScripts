# "ExhaustionAvoidance.ahk"
uses [feiyue's findtext](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834&hilit=findtext) to find when 9/100 is shown on the stamina bar, then forcefully disables the Shift key from being held

may not work if you're not playing on your main monitor or if you're playing on a resolution lower than 1920x1080
# To Use
use the .exe file in the Release section

or install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [feiyue's findtext](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834&hilit=findtext) (with both in the same folder) then run the .ahk file from the repository
# To Build
download the .ahk in the repository, then install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [feiyue's findtext](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834&hilit=findtext)

open AutoHotkey Dash, click compile, then select the ExhaustionAvoidance.ahk file for compile
# F.A.Q.
1. help this isn't working and idk what to do

just create an issue on the top of this thing and i'll probably be able to fix it for you

2. will this get me banned

nah
this is basically undetectable and doesn't insert any scripts into the Roblox client anyway
also you're just using information the game gives you

make an issue if you have any other questions idk what im doing really
